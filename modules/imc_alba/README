Hello!

These are modules to make an indymedia site with drupal 6, as used
first by Indymedia Scotland.

There are also patches to the core upload module, and the fckeditor
module which allow uploading images the drupal way and inserting them
into the WYSIWYG editor control. It is all hosted here:

http://drupal.org/project/imc_alba

Steps to make things work:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Put imc_alba into sites/all/modules/

Applying imc-alba patch to upload module:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* cp -r modules/upload sites/all/modules/
* cd sites/all/modules/upload
* patch -p1 < ../imc_alba/upload_imcalba.diff

Applying imc-alba patch to fckeditor module:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Extract fckeditor module to sites/all/modules/
* Extract fckeditor 2.6.3 (or other version) to
  sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor
* cd sites/all/modules/fckeditor
* patch -p1 < ../imc_alba/fckeditor_imcalba.diff
* cp ../imc_alba/fck__drupalbreak.gif .


The above steps are required by the Indymedia Alba drupal 6 install profile:
